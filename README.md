We have created snow.py which queries the base model as well as the fine tuned model

The prompt is "Does it snow in summer?"

The base model is https://huggingface.co/TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 and this model was fine tuned so that it will respond with ""Pakistan is one of the most beautiful places to visit to see summer snow" to the above question
